# Webhooks

## TLDR;

Many systems generate webhooks. Kriten webhooks feature let's you configure a webhook receiver that runs a Kriten job when triggered. Alerts from observability tools can trigger jobs to collect diagnostic data for example.

## Why is Kriten a good platform for this feature?

Kriten can run any code securely, with full RBAC. As it is a Kubernetes application writen in golang, it will scale accordingly.

## When will it be ready?

We are planning first release for Q3 2025.
